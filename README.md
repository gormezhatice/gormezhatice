#### About Me: An International and Multilingual Journey

As an international and multilingual individual, I am a dedicated and passionate learner who initiated my academic journey in Turkey.

#### Education and Global Exposure

In the pursuit of knowledge, I proudly obtained my undergraduate degree in International Trade from Cankaya University in June 2018. Following my graduation, I explored the USA through the Work and Travel program, immersing myself in various roles within the hospitality sector for four months and indulging in a month of travel across different cities. This experience not only broadened my cultural horizons but also honed my skills in team collaboration, customer interaction, and global engagement.

#### MBA Pursuit in the UK

Motivated by my international exposure, I ventured to the UK to pursue an MBA in International Marketing. My interest in sales and marketing grew from part-time roles during college, which I continued throughout my MBA, culminating in the successful completion of my masters with merit. The onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic during the final semester of my masters presented unprecedented challenges. Opting to stay in London, I dedicated myself to my MBA studies and seized an internship opportunity amid the lockdown. Navigating through the uncertainties and pressures of the pandemic, I emerged as a more resilient individual, both personally and professionally.

#### Passion for Technology and Transition into Data Analytics

From an early age, my fascination with software and technology has been a constant. The pandemic provided me with the opportunity to delve into Adobe software, transforming a personal interest into a professional pursuit. Serving as a Social Media Manager, I've built and managed numerous social media pages from scratch. Over the past two years, I've been on a journey of self-discovery, refining my career goals. This path led me to undertake a data analytics course at LSE, where I excelled and recently completed the Data Analytics Career Accelerator with distinction. Proficient in Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau, I am well-equipped to contribute my multidisciplinary background, analytical mindset, and technical skills to data-driven projects.

#### Professional Journey and Skills

My professional journey includes a three-year tenure, starting as a content creator intern and progressing to an account manager. Beyond my career, I am an art enthusiast and music lover. As a data enthusiast, I approach case studies with curiosity, ensuring thorough analyses to uncover meaningful insights.

#### Ambitious, Self-Sufficient, and Creative

Eager to contribute my diverse skill set to dynamic teams and foster diversity and inclusion, I'm open to connecting and exploring how my background aligns with your organizational goals. In essence, I am an ambitious, self-sufficient, and creative individual with a positive attitude. I thrive on learning new things independently and collaborating with others in the workplace. Ready for the next challenge, I am excited about the prospect of conquering the realm of data.
